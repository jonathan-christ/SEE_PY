## Overview

This repository contains an implementation of clustering analysis using the SEE (Sequence of Events Estimation) method. The goal is to analyze prescription intervals and group them into meaningful clusters using different clustering algorithms, such as K-Means and DBSCAN.

## Features

- Extracts prescription intervals from a dataset
- Computes the Empirical Cumulative Distribution Function (ECDF)
- Identifies significant clustering patterns in prescription intervals
- Supports K-Means and DBSCAN clustering algorithms
- Visualizes results through ECDF and density plots
